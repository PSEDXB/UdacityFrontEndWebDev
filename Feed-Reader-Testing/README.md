## About

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program.  The source files and a detailed explanation of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

All of the code outside of /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js was provided by Udacity.

Alternatively, download this repository and open index.html in your browser of choice.

## Dependencies

This project uses Jasmine 2.1.2 and jQuery 2.1.1, neither of which should cause issues with modern browsers.  

Time permitting, I would like to transpile this project to ES6 and a more recent version of Jasmine.  Stay tuned!
