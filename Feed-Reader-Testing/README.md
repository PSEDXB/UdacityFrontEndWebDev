## About

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program.  The source files and a detailed explanation of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

All of the code outside of /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js was provided by Udacity.

## Learning Outcomes

The purpose of this exercise was to familiarise myself with the Jasmine testing suite.  The tests I have written test the presence of DOM elements (the 'RSS Feeds' suite), the responsiveness of DOM elements to click events (the 'The Menu' suite), and the successful asynchronous loading of the feed (the 'Initial Entries' and 'New Feed Selection' suites).

## Dependencies

This project uses Jasmine 2.1.2 and jQuery 2.1.1.  

Time permitting, I would like to transpile this project to ES6 and use a more recent version of Jasmine.  Stay tuned!
