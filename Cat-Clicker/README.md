# Cat Clicker

This is a silly exercise for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program. All code is mine, warts and all.

To use this app, clone the repo and open up `index.html` in your browser. 

Because the game uses alerts (for now), I recommend using Firefox for aesthetic reasons, but any modern browser should work.  

To play, select a cat and click it to your heart's content!
