## About

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree Program. 

## Instructions

To play, click two cards to reveal their images.  If they match, they will remain open - if not, they will close.

Moves are calculated by the number of pairs you have opened.  You lose one star each at 16 and 30 moves.  No matter what, you will keep one star. :)

Once you have matched all cards, you will receive a victory message with your star score and the time it took for you to win the game.

Good luck, and stay tuned for increased functionality and upcoming design improvements! 

## Dependencies

Besides Google and Bootstrap fonts, this project relies on no external projects or libraries - it is an exercise in 'vanilla' JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

This project does use ES6, which may cause issues for users of IE 11, Opera Mini, and Samsung Internet web browsers.
