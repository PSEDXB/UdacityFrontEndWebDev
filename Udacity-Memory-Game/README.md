## Instructions

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree Program. 

To play, click two cards to reveal their images.  If a match, they will remain open - if not, they will close.

Moves are calculated by the number of pairs you have opened.  You lose one star each at 16, 30, and 40 moves.

Once you have matched all cards, you will receive a victory message with your star score and the time it took for you to win the game.

Good luck, and stay tuned for increased functionality and upcoming design improvements!
