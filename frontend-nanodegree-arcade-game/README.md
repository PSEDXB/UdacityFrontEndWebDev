## About

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree Program. Almost all of the code outside of the app.js file was provided by Udacity.

## Starting the Game

The game can be accessed at the following URL:

<http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/PeteEdgerton/UdacityFrontEndWebDev/blob/master/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/index.html>

Alternatively, you can download the folder on Github and open the index.html file on your browser of choice.

## Playing the Game

To play, use the arrow keys to control the player.

If you get to the water, you win!  

If you get hit by a bug...you dead! 

## Dependencies

This project relies on no external projects or libraries - it is an exercise in vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

This project does use ES6, which may cause issues for users of IE 11, Opera Mini, and Samsung Internet web browsers.  Additionaly, the canvas animation may cause issues for users of Opera Mini.
